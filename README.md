# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques, specifically content-based filtering, vectorization, and cosine similarity. 
The system is built with Python and utilizes libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, and scikit-learn. Additionally, it provides an intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their attributes and user preferences.
- **Vectorization**: Converts textual data into numerical vectors for machine learning algorithms.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between movies to provide relevant recommendations.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers personalized movie suggestions tailored to individual user tastes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## My Learning

This project helped me gain experience in:

- I learned about how to implement machine learning algorithms for recommendation systems.
- Scrubbing of raw data using numpy and pandas.
- Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, and scikit-learn.
- Understanding of concepts like cosine similarity and vectorization.
- My first interaction with streamlit and it's usage for UI development and deploying.

## How it Works

The system analyzes movie attributes (specifically genre, movie actors, director ,rating and synopsis ) and user preferences to generate recommendations. It uses content-based filtering to find similarities between movies based on their features. The cosine similarity metric is employed to measure the similarity between movies, enabling accurate recommendations.


## About the Interface

The user interface is designed with Streamlit, providing an intuitive way to interact with the recommendation system. Users can input their preference, and the 
system will generate upto 5 personalized movie recommendations accordingly.
